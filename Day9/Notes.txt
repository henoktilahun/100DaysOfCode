Dictionaries
- Dictionaries in python kinda work like real Dictionaries
- Two parts to it 
    - Key + Vaule
    - e.x. Key = Bug , Value = " An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected"
    - {key: Value}
    - {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected"}
    - can be seperate via commans
    - Keys have to be a datatype? or correct datatype - can't just type words - will think it's a variable
